# StuLoans
App

The financial need, especially with students is great. Many students don't have the financial means to cope through the month, and some can't call home. 

This is where StuLoans comes into play.

StuLoans is an app designed for NWU students. This app aims to help students financially, by letting them borrow money and then paying back at a specific time (students specify). 

The amount borrowed depends on the income stream of the students (bursary, etc). The app will therefore use that information to determine how much money can be borrowed, interest included. Interest is calculated (20% per R100). 

To sign up for a loan, all they need is to provide their student and identify card, and the app will do the rest.
